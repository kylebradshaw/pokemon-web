# Pokemon GO Web Client
Now you can interact with official Pokemon GO's server with a web client!
You can use your arrow keys to walk and your mouse to catch pokemons. Everything is displayed in a nice way using Google Maps.
Also, you can use pokestops, transfer/evolve pokemons and use/drop items.
In this version, you actually see other players on map and can even chat with them.
Just login with your facebook account and link how many Pokemon GO accounts to it, so you can switch between your trainers.
